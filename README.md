## Team Fuzzy Bell: Secure Communication with entangled particles

* [Thomas Decker](), [Mar Gomez](),
* The challenge:
  > Stock exchanges need to talk and compare order
books as fast as possible. Therefore, the communications between
stock exchanges need to be secure, reliable and fast. Currently, errors
and opportunities occur during lack of synchronization, not secure
communication. Quantum Communication projects perform research on
the creation, transmission, interfacing, storage, processing and
measurement of optical qubits. Which promise to be faster in pre- and
postprocessing and secure during transmission. To provide a quantum network to fulfil all of the
above requirements a good measure for entanglement needs to be introduced. “squashed
entanglement” or “CMI entanglement” promises to deliver a good measure. Stock exchanges can,
with the help of a squashed entangled pair for bipartite quantum system, communicate secure
and faster in pre- and postprocessing.

## Team Quantumacy: Finding arbitrage opportunities

* [Yvo Keuter](https://github.com/ykeuter), [Davit Khachatryan](https://github.com/DavitKhach), and [Olli Ahonen](https://github.com/olliahonen)
* The challenge:
   > Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets. One example is cross-currency arbitrage. The problem of arbitrage detection is commonly solved by defining a directed graph in which the nodes are the assets and the edge weights are equal to minus the logarithm of the conversion rate and searching searching for negative cycles. In contrast, the problem of finding the most profitable arbitrage opportunity of arbitrary length is NP-hard, and hence the time complexity of an algorithm solving it to optimality is expected to be exponential.
The challenge is to create a QAOA which can be mapped onto an arbitrage cycle and gives the most profitable solution.

## Team TheWalker; Quantum Random Walks

* [Sami Boulebname](https://github.com/sami-b95), [Leonhard Neuhaus](https://github.com/lneuhaus), [Jan Glatz](), [Cristeam Caiola](), [Josif Levant](), [Krystian Gaus](), [Manfred Rieck](), [Peter Eder]()

* The challnge:
  > The random walk theory suggests that changes in stock prices have the
same distribution and are independent of each other, therefore, the past movement or trend of a
stock price or market cannot be used to predict its future movement. The theory implies that
statistically stock-price fluctuations are independent over time and may be described by a
random process-e.g., the tossing of a coin or the selection of a sequence of numbers from a
random number table
Quantum Walks are the quantum mechanical analogs to classical random walks. Unlike classical
objects, particles performing a quantum walk can be in a superposition state and take all possible
paths through their environment simultaneously, leading to faster propagation and enhanced
sensitivity to initial conditions. These properties make quantum walks interesting to studying
future behaviour and movements of financial indicators.
